# HamScript

HamScript is a fully fledged programming language inspired by the dankest of memes. It is currently in the design phase but the plan is to ultimately implement it using the rpython toolchain supplied by pypy.

The grammar of the language is entirely derived from soundbytes from the immortal clip from the Simpsons that has come to be known as Steamed Hams.

## Overview of the HamScript language
TODO when a rough outline for the design of the language is settled upon.

## Contributing
The project is completely open to contributions from anyone. Building an interpreter is a very illuminating experience for anyone who has interest in software. Whether you are a seasoned professional at hacking on compilers / interpreters or you don't even know where to begin, we want you to try and learn and contribute.
